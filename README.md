# Installation Instructions

_If you are installing the list from the Wabbajack Gallery, do Step 2 and skip ahead to Step 5_

_If you are installing using the Nexus Mods file, follow ALL instructions carefully_

### Step 1: Downloads
Download the Wabbajack installer.

Download the Project 2077.zip file from the downloads section on this page.
﻿
### Step 2: Create Folder Structure
Create a folder in your drive root called Wabbajack (example: C:\Wabbajack)

Inside the Wabbajack Folder, create 3 new folders, called Wabbajack, Project 2077 and Wabbajack Downloads (example: C:\Wabbajack\Wabbajack, C:\Wabbajack\Project 2077 and C:\Wabbajack\Wabbajack Downloads)

Important: Add exceptions in Windows Defender and any Antivirus software you use for both folders! No, there isn't malware in the list. Some scripting mods do tend to get false positive flags in AV software. All files are hosted on Nexus, and Nexus does a full virus scan on all files before it can be hosted, so it is safe.

### Step 3: ﻿Place Downloads
Place the Wabbajack.exe you downloaded inside the second Wabbajack Folder (C:\Wabbajack\Wabbajack\Wabbajack.exe)

Extract the Project 2077.zip file in the same folder.

It should look like this when you're done.

### Step 7: Final Steps
Run Mod Organizer from the shortcut on your Desktop.

In the top right corner of Mod Organizer, click on the Run Button and wait for Cyberpunk 2077 to launch.
